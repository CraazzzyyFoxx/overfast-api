On the run from the law as a young man, Cassidy became a founding member of the notorious Deadlock Gang, which trafficked in illicit weapons and military hardware throughout the American Southwest. Eventually, the gangâ€™s luck ran out, and Overwatch busted Cassidy and several of his associates. With his expert marksmanship and resourcefulness, Cassidy was given the choice between rotting in a maximum-security lockup and joining Blackwatch, Overwatch's covert ops division. He chose the latter. Although initially cynical, Cassidy came to believe that he could make amends for his past by righting the injustices of the world. He appreciated the flexibility afforded to the clandestine Blackwatch, unhindered by bureaucracy and red tape. But as Overwatch's influence waned, rogue elements within Blackwatch sought to bring down the organization and turn it to their own ends. Wanting no part of the infighting, Cassidy set off alone. He resurfaced several years later as a gunslinger for hire. But while Cassidy's talents are sought after by parties great and small, he fights only for causes he believes are just."
